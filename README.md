## 🌟 Overview

**SnapClass** is a state-of-the-art, next-generation attendance management system designed to bring speed, high-fidelity security, and effortless tracking to modern classrooms. By leveraging hybrid AI technologies—**FaceID** (Computer Vision) and **VoiceID** (Acoustic Biometrics)—SnapClass completely eliminates paper rosters, proxy attendance, and manual log-ins.

This repository hosts the Next.js landing page which acts as the visual flagship and portal for students and teachers. Under the hood, it links directly to our cloud-native Streamlit & Flask AI engine, communicating in real-time with our PostgreSQL infrastructure hosted on Supabase.

## 🛠️ Key Product Features

### 👨‍🏫 The Teacher's Journey
1. **Secure Login**: Access controls via high-grade authentication protocols.
2. **Unified Dashboard**: Manage classrooms, subjects, rosters, and live statistics in a singular view.
3. **Course Creator**: Launch new subjects instantly, automatically provisioning dedicated databases.
4. **FaceID Scanning**: Capture a single photo of the classroom. The AI-vision pipeline processes, aligns, detects, and logs all present students within milliseconds.
5. **VoiceID Roll-call**: An interactive audio loop. Students say *"Present"* sequentially, and the AI compares voice signatures against registered voice embeddings in real-time.
6. **Actionable Analytics**: Review high-fidelity confidence scores, update exceptions manually, and export logs to standardized CSV files.

### 🧑‍🎓 The Student's Journey
1. **QR Enrollment**: Scan unique, dynamic QR codes displayed by the teacher to join courses in seconds.
2. **One-Time Biometric Registration**: Securely register facial patterns and voice signatures.
3. **Personal Portal**: View individual attendance percentages, timelines, and course compliance scores across all enrolled subjects.

## 📐 System Architecture

SnapClass fuses top-tier web architectures with state-of-the-art Python artificial intelligence pipelines.

### 🧠 The Biometric AI Pipeline
* **FaceID Recognition**: Employs deep residual networks to compute 128-dimension face descriptors. Dlib performs HOG/CNN-based facial detection and affine transformation to correct head poses in varying lighting environments.
* **VoiceID Embedding Match**: Utilizes standard mel-spectrogram representations and deep LSTM networks (via Resemblyzer) to encode voice prints into 256-dimension voice embeddings, comparing similarity against reference prints in real-time.

## 🎨 Visual Premium Features

The landing page features high-end aesthetics curated to wow users upon their first visit:
* **Liquid Glass (`.liquid-glass`)**: Tailored glassmorphism effect using `backdrop-filter: blur`, combined with an dynamic SVG border linear-gradient mask simulating a luxury reflective sheen.
* **Border Beam (`BorderBeam`)**: Elegant CSS animation drawing a custom-colored, fast-moving laser beam tracing along the border path of glass panels.
* **Runtime Protection (`SafeSectionWrapper`)**: High-order Error Boundary system protecting the production site from crashing. Even if an animation or video element encounters a render error, the rest of the application remains fully interactive.
* **Cinematic Backgrounds**: Direct stream of ultra-smooth MP4 video loops, managed by custom vanilla JS requestAnimationFrame loop triggers to achieve smooth fadeIn/fadeOut transitions upon buffering.
